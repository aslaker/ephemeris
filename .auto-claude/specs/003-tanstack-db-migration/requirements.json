	"task_description": "# TanStack DB Migration\n\nMigrate from the current TanStack Query + Dexie combination to unified TanStack DB collections for reactive, consistent data management. This simplifies the data layer and enables more powerful offline-first patterns.\n\n## Rationale\nThe current dual data layer creates complexity and potential consistency issues. TanStack DB provides a unified solution that's already partially integrated, reducing maintenance burden and enabling better offline support.\n\n## User Stories\n- As a user, I want data to sync seamlessly between online and offline modes so that I can use the app anywhere\n- As a developer, I want a unified data layer so that I don't need to maintain two separate caching systems\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] All Dexie stores are migrated to TanStack DB collections\n- [ ] React Query caches are replaced with TanStack DB live queries\n- [ ] Offline data persistence works correctly after migration\n- [ ] No regression in data loading performance\n- [ ] Developer documentation updated for new data patterns\n",
